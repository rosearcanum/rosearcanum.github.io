 <div id="hello"><h2>Hello.</h2></div>

	<p>It has been a very long time since I have last spoken to you like this. I hope the format I have chosen to do so is, at the very least, familiar, yet still different in some respects. I would not have it in any other way, as I feel that mirrors the changes I have undergone in my own life that have taken me to where I am today—for better or for worse. I will say that my technical abilities have improved since then, but the edge and drive I once had seems to be somewhat missing from the picture. It is still there, but it does not come as seamlessly as it once did. I suppose you could see the continuation of a blogpost from over three years ago as not only a makeshift attempt to jump-start my old mannerisms of writing and style, but also to rejuvenate some of my older writing with a newer perspective.</p>
	<p>You can probably guess the rest. Welcome back to any returning readers—and if you are 
new here, hello and thanks for joining. Just like with all the old and new faces this time around, this blogpost will serve as just that—a reunion of the old and the new, with the exception of the old being revamped to fit current conventions. It will not be a complete overhaul of the original writing. It will be, for the most part, given another glance to improve on grammar oversights and on any humor that fails to appeal. I know that what’s considered “funny” and what “isn’t” is all subjective truth, but it’s my world and you’re all just living in it, so I get to call the shots around here.

	<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
	<p>The last time we were here, we spoke about Anisa Jomha, also known as “The Internet’s Girlfriend." If this is your first time visiting, I recommend reading chronologically from the beginning to become familiar with the characters of the story. If you’ve already read the previous installment before, it’s your choice whether you wish to skip that section or reread it to regain a better understanding of the context of more current situations. Feel free to use the Table of Contents below as not just a guide for where this story will take us, but as a direct jump to whichever part of the timeline you wish to read about first. Thank you, and let us now enjoy this trip down memory lane.</p>

	</ul>
	<h2 id="communism">The Internet's Girlfriend</h2>
		<p>Anisa Jomha is a 31-year-old streamer who is currently married to 
			the washed-up YouTube celebrity, iDubbbzTV, and is lovingly 
			dubbed as "Idubbbz gf" by the internet as a result—foretelling 
			the lack of relevancy and respect she has of her own merit. In a
			vain attempt to sound interesting, 
			Anisa tweeted that she is both 
			<a href="https://x.com/AnisaTheGreasy/status/1619419503112359936">
			Lebanese and Irish</a>, and with the foresight of the 
			perturbing events that'll soon follow, this fact may lead 
			one to wonder whether the eugenicists were onto something 
			after all.</p>
		<p>She was formerly a titty streamer known as "Raihnbowkidz", 
			an art practiced by those armed with tissues and push-up 
			bras to subjugate their audience of lackeys to give them money 
			for whining about how hard life is when making six-figures streaming themselves playing League all day.
			She, however, 
			developed very little traction in this field, as her MtF 
			Maxmoefoe appearance didn't help matters when it came to fostering
			a predominantly gooner viewerbase. </p>
		<p>After realizing that she would not receive much attention from her appearance 
			nor her strange opinions involving the Holocaust being a justifiable,
			her only logical conclusion was to sleep with anyone that had even an ounce
			of clout, jumping between multiple men before finally striking pyrite with Ian. 
			At the time, he was notorious for his content cops and was considered 
			"untouchable" by unemployed, YouTube standards. As with any YouTuber, 
			his virginity was still intact before meeting her, marking him a very
			easy target for Anisa to sink her dark voodoo Muslim magick onto him, making him supple
			to her every whim. </p>	
		<p>Admittedly, she became both him and I's sunk cost fallacy, 
			where the investment in this woman has gone too far to be disturbed 
			by any sense of reasoning. As time and time again, 
			Anisa would lambast Ian on her public Discord 
			server whilst he remained blind to her consistently revealing 
			sensitive information to a grander audience. The most recent occurrence
			of this egregious behavior is during the fundraiser livestream for their 
			failed brainchild, Creator Clash 2, where she asks him in front of a live audience
			of thousands if "[he's] always been shitting [his] pants" 
			(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8Xc69_J4jU">source</a>). 
			She's not like other girls, she <i>will</i> ruin your life if left unchecked. </p>

alt="Anisa talking trash" class="trash">

	<p>As much of an obnoxious manchild that Ian very well is, you're not much
	of a gem yourself, Anisa. I have seen the insides of your house, you have,
	in fact, needed to relocate several times since your OnlyFans kept doxxing
	your whereabouts. Without fail, I have seen dog feces cake your floors in 
	each one of the houses you've lived in. You don't cook, you don't clean, your
	tattoos make you look like a public bathroom filled with crude drawings of penises.
	But say Ian were to expose you for any one of these flaws, and he'd spend the night chained
	in the doghouse. Don't get me wrong, he's still just another side of Anisa's coin.
	He is a spineless fence-sitter that has only ever expressed opinions that are shared by the general
	masses. He has surely "learned and grown", at the most conveniently profitable time when YouTube
	was no longer endorsing edgy content. However, considering that he was the only reason she even had a 
	platform that was not propelled by gooners with a ladyboy fetish, I believe that she should,
	at the very least, give him a modicum of respect.</p>
	<p>Despite this, Ian bends over backwards to accommodate for Anisa and her 
	high demands by paying for her breast implants. Because no 
	aphrodisiac is greater than sucking on the silicone meat shields strapped 
	onto the chest of any woman who goes under the knife for this 
	procedure. Regardless, I hope she enjoys her self-inflicted back pain and 
	the sex doll-esque appearance. I wonder if iDubbbz has to blow her up as 
	a form of foreplay before being able to fuck her? So many questions, so 
	little answers to substantiate them. Just cut the bullshit and DROP THE IDUBBBZTV SEX TAPE ANISA,
	WE HAVE QUESTIONS THAT MUST BE ANSWERED.</p>
	<p>In addition, she finds herself thirsting over Chris Ray Gun's dick on stream, 
	despite both parties already being in a relationship. It's clear that Anisa 
	has a type for scrawny manlets that look like they prefer being bottomed, 
	so it's of little surprise THAT Chris had fallen victim to her forlorning attempts
	at trying to flirt with the highschooler mentality her brain had mentally set 
	itself on.</p>
<div class="raygun">

</div>
	<p>It is quite fascinating that there are people out there who willingly broadcast
	their unbridled jealousy as if it's something to be proud of. I have never seen 
	a more obvious case than here, where of course Anisa believes being a pornstar is considered
	"a compliment". Yes, because being so insecure in your own dignity that you feel the need to sell your
	body for attention by internet dwellers is the pinnacle of high accolades. 
	The peculiarity of what Anisa sees in Chris is generally unfounded, as Chris 
	is essentially a watered-down version of Ian. You'll find this lack 
	of reasoning to be a common theme throughout our journey with Anisa.</p>

	<p>In the search for meaning in her life, Anisa finally settled on the most 
	conclusive fate that e-girls typically have. She made an OnlyFans, blessing us with her
	drive-by evisceration upon scrolling past 
	her advertisements of this <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/784/128/f1d.jpg">
	on Twitter</a>.</p>

	<p>She finally joined the ranks of DNA-guzzling nymphos that populate the site.</p>

	<p> Now, the rise of the site itself is shrouded in great mystique, as many women 
	see it as an alternative to being unemployed (a modern woman favorite), yet making decent money on the 
	side, with little to no repercussions. They don't account for the psychological 
	damage induced by having your body put on the internet for judgment. There'll 
	remain a sense of the need to pander to their audience, as though the validation 
	propagated by strangers is the Xanax to their undiagnosed BPD.</p>

	<p>It'll start with posting nudes and censoring the most sought after parts, 
	then they'll start finding themselves performing a bukkake with 5 black men in a year's time. 
	No fall but preceded by a declination. This is the slope that many women who fell into this site's
	trap later endured.</p>

	<p>Ian decided to post a video, as he was likely fearful Anisa would revoke his 
	privileges of letting him watch from a closet—dressed as 
	Superman of course—while she finds out how many backshots it will take to kill someone. 
	When filming, Ian looks like a disheveled chemotherapy patient, with tissues littering his desk—the same
	ones he used to clean the sperm off of Anisa's face after her performance last night.</p>

	<p>Throughout the video, he defends the choices made by his girlfriend, while in 
	tandem, destroying the very respect granted to him over the years. His fans, 
	who were dropping like flies after inhaling an overabundance of copium, went 
	through the mental gymnastics necessary to protect the once beloved golden 
	child of YouTube by taking to Reddit to express in their preschooler vernacular
	on how cuckoldry is actually very manly, in classic Redditor fashion.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, Anisa appealed to the crowd of necrophiliacs by appearing dead inside 
	with each photo taken of her, while also posting photos of herself scantily clad 
	in public—girlbossing her way into a sex offender registry like all the rest of them do. </p>

	<p>As previously stated, there is a permanent sense of desperate attention seeking
	that spirals into a path of self destruction and loathing for one's body, 
	as they fear they will not appeal to the masses once they lose their beauty. 
	Plastic surgery is a common out for them, conforming to beauty standards in order 
	to remain young and beautiful forever. Not with Anisa. 
	She instead decides to cover up her insecurities by littering her body with tattoos, 
	that she seems to not put much thought or effort in.</p>

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/kVMRkLdP/tattoo.jpg" alt="Ugly ahh bat tattoo" class="tattoo">

	<p>]While they're fucking and Ian grabs onto her love handles, I wonder if he's staring 
	back at the bat the whole time? I'd try to aim for the mouth, if I were him.</p>

	<p>Impulsive tattoos of this caliber should be categorized as a symptom under the DSM-5 
	for Stage 4 Daddy Issues. However, Anisa made it known that there exists no boundaries
	 between her and this path of self-destruction, as she became more privy to making 
	 impulsive decisions regarding her appearance; the main selling point of her current 
	 careerpath.</p>

	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/chq0TVRL/bald.jpg" alt="Chemotherapy patient transformation" class="bald">

	<p>She finally completed her transformation into the transgender version of Sid from Toy Story. 
	Since, as a part of the honeymoon gift for their wedding, Anisa decided to elevate their 
	relationship by going with a more "alternative" look. That'll surely turn heads in public,
	for all the wrong reasons. Ian—who most certainly owns an Ashley Madison account by now—must've 
	had his balls in a headlock by Brad the Bull, as he simply couldn't muster up the testosterone to give a 
	definitive "no" to his wife.</p>

	<p>If he were subtle, his approach would've been to book a therapist for her impulsivity; 
	instead, he took out the razor and started hacking away—lest he lose the Nintendo Switch 
	privileges that his wife's boyfriend, Jamal, ever so graciously granted to him. This 
	decision relegated Anisa to finally completing the look of a cocaine-addled aberration 
	that people would pay a dollar to view and pelt rotten tomatoes at inside of a circus 
	tent, leading to a severe drought in the flow of subscriptions she'd regularly receive. 
	This lead to a stark juxtaposition between her validating her decisions and later 
	withdrawing them as she expresses how she wishes to grow her hair back once again.</p>

	<p>One has to wonder whether this level of self-awareness applies to other aspects of her life, 
	and in truth, it does, as she goes to Twitter to rant about how she wishes there were 
	a "go back button" for her online presence. A return to form for her glorious days of pushing 
	her tits out and thirsting over Chris once again.</p>

	<p>In a rather desperate attempt to regain the fame once lost to time when he began
	focusing on the thoughts of the head between his legs rather than the man upstairs, 
	Ian decided to take the bait of accepting a boxing match from the notorious deadbeat, Ricegum.
	Frankly, it seemed completely out of character for Ian to jump the gun and accept the 
	challenge when considering Ricegum's known track record.</p>

	<p>But clearly, Anisa now wears the pants in the relationship, and forced this manlet 
	to start hitting the gym, booking reservations, and essentially going the full 9 
	yards, all without receiving a follow-up from Ricegum. After it was inevitably revealed 
	that Ricegum didn't actually care about doing a boxing match, Ian decided to 
	bitch about it on video, only serving to expose himself by how much her wife's impulsivity seems to 
	rub off on him.</p>

	<p>There's nothing more intimidating than a bald man, wearing a fake moustache 
	he poached from Dollar Tree, to stand in front of the camera, fists clenched, 
	and mustering the most angry face he could possibly hope to make with his physiognomy. 
	You're a very tough guy Ian, but I'm sure Tyrone already tells you that when he tucks you 
	in for bed every night. Due to this clearly fear mongering video, many possible opponents were deterred 
	from messing with the foul beast that is iDubbbzTV. Despite begging on the 
	doorsteps of every relevant content creator, most didn't want to be 
	granted the sadistic opportunity of kicking Ian's face, forcing Ian's 
	hand to post on Tik Tok to beg for those with clout to DM him if 
	interested. </p>

<h2 id="creator-clash-1">The Controveries of Creator Clash</h2>
	<P>And as though his prayers were answered, Ian finally cemented this fantasy of getting his shit
		kicked in by founding the creation of Creator Clash. To summarize the "goal" of the event, it
		is a boxing event that morally grandstands over every other boxing event by posturing that it's for charity,
		and that each of the fighters are selflessly giving up their YouTube careers for months to train and 
		leave bruises on eachother by the end of it. Which isn't too big of a deal, since most of the boxers
		in the card are washed-up has-beens that are using this event as a way of hopefully repurposing their
		identity by gaining an iota of relevancy. Now, all of this is already met with some skepticism, especially
		regarding the logistics of where the money is going exactly, or the lack thereof. How else
		could you explain $250,000 going missing? (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VZ084lzyBo">source</a>).</p> 
		
	<p>Let's be real here, 
		not a single YouTuber is doing this for selfless reasons, that would directly go against the fundamentals 
		of being a YouTuber if that were the case. Ian can spin whatever narrative he wants, but one thing he'll
		always have going against him is his idiot wife, who is in such desperate need of internet validation that she's
		already made many public statements regarding fighter pay. She claims that fighters already make a minimum of 
		twenty thousand dollars, which would be amended to a higher amount after the fight. However, a few fighters have 
		gone on record claiming that they made a percentage cut from ticket sales, which was capped at ninety-five thousand dollars.
		So fighters did not make twenty thousand from the fights, never trust a Muslim on their word. John Morrison, one of the 
		fighters for the event, was very open with the fact that he was purely doing it for monetary reasons, which sort of
		defeats the whole personal sacrifice narrative they keep pushing for sympathy points. Now, Anisa claims that the twenty-thousand
		dollars given to each fighter goes directly into their training, which I think is absurd considering their performance in the ring.
		Ian was getting slapped around so hard by Doctor Mike that they shortened the round times from three minutes to two so he could
		stand a chance, and he still lost. Incredible, considering Ian paid a hundred dollars minimum for coaching by Michael Briggs.
		You know Michael Briggs, <i>the</i> Michael Briggs, 
		the one who fought two whole MMA matches at the time and trained in the same gym as Mighty Mouse.
		Anisa once went on stream and explained her logic that because they trained in the same gym, it meant
		that they were on par with eachother and the most qualified coach for Ian. I know the wound is still healing
		from the ego bruise, but Sam Hyde would have unironically been a better choice for Ian's coach. He may not be classically
		trained, but he would've lead Ian to victory against all odds while teaching him a thing or two on life skills.
		Ian was this close to learning stick shift and gaining a spine, but couldn't because he had to return 
		home to his handler. Let that sink in. 

		<p>Besides the whole "putting your career on pause for charity" narrative being colorful,
			it's total horseshit. You could absolutely still release videos. I don't think any of these YouTubers
			bought mansions so they could shut themselves in a single room for hours to edit videos by themselves. They
			all absolutely have editors, or at the very least could afford one. Imagine doing 5 hours of training semi-regularly. Really spoken 
			like a guy's who never held a real job before. 
		</p>
		<img src="https://i.ibb.co/PHzc6LC/80f99878-36cf-4bbf-9695-28a5d01d76f3.jpg" alt="The organizers of creator clash being silly on main" class="cookie">

		<p>If the real goal of all of this was indeed for charity's sake, Ian and Anisa would cut the middle
			man of being left in crippling debt by the lack of funds raised and just shoot a charity stream
			instead with all of the creators that were intended to box for the event. None of them would do it because
			they're greedy as fuck but it's a good idea in theory. Creator Clash seems like the shittiest way to 
			raise money, there are terrorist organizations out there that have accomplished more good than their event has.
			Instead of whatever godawful idea they're gonna come up with, how about this? Lower the cost of the event, get 
			more interesting fighters than ones who can barely crack a few hundred views. I could make a YouTube video 
			right now and probably get more views than some of the people on Creator Clash 2's card. Instead of looking in
			the mirror and realizing the problem lies with them, they blame piracy for their lack of pay-per-views. I'm happy 
			for their high self-esteem, but nobody wants to watch their fight because it's filled with nobodies. The only advertisement
			this event got was FroggyFresh being kicked and subsequently banned from attending the premises, which they
			received relentless mocking for as a result. I will go on record here and now and say that I'm praying on Creator Clash 3's 
			downfall. Yes I don't care if the cancer patients die, I think they're better off succumbing to a fate of radiation fucking up
			their body through chemotherapy than being used a prop in Anisa and Ian's game of winning credibility by the masses.
			There is nothing out there that they care more about than themselves, and they will ruthlessly stab the back of anyone 
			that gets in the way of that. 
		</p>
	</P>
	<h2 id="return">The Return of Content Cop</h2>
		<p>Finally, the Content Cop on H3 has finally <a href="https://youtu.be/NyB85pVw-v4?si=prE2AU3f86P8LUYQ">been released</a>, and it is the most underwhelming event of the year and it’s not even close. First of all, I’m surprised Ian brought back the cop costume, considering the audience he’s trying to appeal to now. Him defending 9/11 cannot distract me from the fact that every policeman is a fascist and ACAB; however, now I’m curious about the potential Derek Chauvin and iDubbbzTV collaboration seeing that the former might get pardoned soon—will this be the cure to Ian’s loss of racism? Second of all, congratulations on creating a video that cracked seven million views, because that is never happening again now that people have seen you still have zero entertainment value to offer. If anything, this means that their podcast will finally crack a view count above a thousand and maybe this time around it won’t be filled with a-loggers. Unsurprisingly, Anisa is nowhere to be found in this video. Funny, she’ll happily appear in a Super Monkey Ball arcade cabinet video, but whenever a video with an ounce of accountability is being addressed (Addressing the Froggy Fresh Drama, “I miss the old Idubbbz”, The Harsh Reality of Creator Clash 2), she’s suddenly nowhere to be found. Oh wait that’s right, she’s oiling up for Hasan in the other room, I forgot about that detail.
		</p>
		<p>All jokes aside, I promise you, this video was orchestrated by Anisa, no matter how much she’ll try to convince you otherwise after she sees the like-to-dislike ratio. Look no further than Ian’s body language throughout the video. For instance, his eyes are never focused on the camera anymore. If you were to pay attention to the level of focus he had in any of the previous Content Cops, you’ll see that he always, without fail, looked directly into the camera, which shows the intention and confidence he had in his words. Even though I’ve never cared for his Content Cops, I can at least recognize the passion that was so clearly evident in those videos. Here, he barely maintains that level of eye contact. He’d do an awkward look-away at least once every ten seconds, as if subconsciously knowing that even he doesn’t believe a word of what he’s saying, so how could he expect his audience to? For this reason, I will never concede with Anisa’s claims that she was only responsible for his older content, and has had no say in any of his newer stuff. But I will say that she is getting eerily close with Hasan’s dog, and her skin is quite pale. I’m only (half) kidding of course, I think her sights are more set on the turkroach cock, which I suppose wouldn’t be too much of a difference from a dog’s, but that’s neither here nor there.
			<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7JBp4z7Y/Whats-App-Image-2025-05-18-at-12-04-41-AM.jpg" alt="iDubbbzTV developed autism???" class="autism"> 
		</p><p>The point is, this video seems like an attempt to impress Hasan, and if the Jomhas haven’t already been sodomized by him, they definitely were after they were done filming. I can’t quite think of another explanation as to why they brought up the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, if not for the fact that Ethan being a Jew makes Hasan very uncomfortable, especially since it seems as though history is repeating itself as Ethan continues to take the win, with the Jew getting one over the Muslim yet again.
</p>
		<p>Now picture this. Imagine waking up as a Palestinian, seeing thousands of people dead in the streets that you grew up in, infinitesimal chunks of your family strewn around the pavement to the point beyond recognition, buildings crumbling to dust, and yet, your worth is further reduced by a limp-wristed faggot using your suffering as collateral fodder for YouTube drama. That has to be haram, right? My favorite part of the video is when Ian says “my wife is Lebanese and Irish so she knows a thing or two about oppression” your wife is also a talentless whore who has never held a real job and has to fabricate her life experiences to make up for her lack of genuine personality. She’s not a Muslim, she most likely does not speak Arabic (if she did she would’ve been using it as bragging rights a long time ago), she’s Canadian-born, I doubt she’s ever visited Lebanon in her entire life—matter of fact, how much do you want to bet that she couldn’t even point it out on a map? Hila is actually from Israel, they even started their channel while living there. Slurs aside, I can at least respect that they’re not using their ethnicity as political leverage against a supposed friend. They didn’t ask for your rudimentary commentary on the genocide or the war in Gaza, they wanted you to defend them from your vitriolic editor and say that they are good parents and pet owners, as you may have witnessed when visiting them during the countless times they have defended you over the cuckoldry allegations. But I guess Ian wouldn’t understand. Anisa’s current form would make anyone that would sleep with her so infertile that children are immediately out of the question, and their rottweiler has broken through a window and terrorized their neighborhood once before when they left it alone at their house, so I doubt they could fathom the responsibility of taking care of another living being, let alone doing so correctly. 
</p>
		<p>I will say though, that irregardless of Ian’s inability to crack a joke anymore, consequently lulling the viewer to a sense of boredom, he suddenly slaps you in the face with a scene of him bawling his eyes out at a therapist, and the hour you wasted watching Mr. Empath go around in circles without making a valid point is immediately made all the more worth it for that moment alone. It’s entertaining to see, considering that Ian probably only included that part to garner sympathy as if to show the audience he actually empathized with Ethan and Hila all along—almost makes you believe that Ethan called CPS on his kids rather than the other way around. More deceitful and manipulative than a Jew, takes a certain skill to accomplish that.
</p>
<p>I'll say it here and now. This is what LA does to a nigga.</p>
